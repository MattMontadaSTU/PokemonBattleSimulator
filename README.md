# PokemonBattleSimulator

This is my Final Project for Java where i create an app for Android that involves Pokemon Battling. It features many of the qualities that
make the games so memorable: strategies, a variety of pokemon to use, and cool moves to use. The only thing i was not able to do was to
have the Pokemon appear on-screen and the title screen for the app because i did not want to get in trouble for copyright issues involving the creation of these two aspects of my project, and because i kept getting multiple errors as i attempted to insert them into my app

# Battle

This class is used as the main function where the program will be run. The functions that are used in the main function are used for 
switch cases that prompt the user to choose which pokemon to use, and what pokemon will go first based on the speed stats

# Pokemon

This class is used to create the stats, typings, and moves for each Pokemon that will be used during the game. The functions in this class
were used to print the moves the Pokemon, and type effectiveness damage calculations

# Individual Pokemon Classes (Blaziken, Swampert, Sceptile, Pikachu, Feraligatr, Typhlosion, Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise, Venasaur)

These classes were made to be part of the selection of Pokemon that will be used to play the game. Each of these clases includes every
individual Pokemon's typings, stats, and moves.
